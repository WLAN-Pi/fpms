v2.00-alpha - Move to single FPMS & rebuilt as modular code 

*** Note ****
If you are moving from the previous Bakebit/NanoHatOLED GitHub repos, you must also perform the following steps once you have installed FPMS using pkg_admin:

(Note this is a one-way operation - you will need to re-image your WLAN Pi if there are any issues and you wish to revert)

1. Edit the oled-start file : "sudo nano /usr/local/bin/oled-start"

    from:

        #!/bin/sh
        cd /home/wlanpi/NanoHatOLED
        ./NanoHatOLED

    to:

        #!/bin/sh
        cd /home/wlanpi/fpms
        ./NanoHatOLED

2. Run "sudo crontab -e" and change :

        @reboot /home/wlanpi/NanoHatOLED/BakeBit/Software/Python/scripts/networkinfo/networkinfocron.sh

    to:

        @reboot /home/wlanpi/fpms/BakeBit/Software/Python/scripts/networkinfo/networkinfocron.sh

3. Remove the old NanoHatOLED folder:

    cd ~
    sudo rm -rf ./NanoHatOLED

4. Sync filesystem:

    sudo sync

5. Power off/on (not reboot from CLI ) the WLAN Pi
