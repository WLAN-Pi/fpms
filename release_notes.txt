v2.0.0 - Move to single FPMS & rebuilt as modular code 

*** Note ****
If you are moving from the previous Bakebit/NanoHatOLED GitHub repos, you must also perform the following steps once you have installed FPMS using pkg_admin:

(Note this is a one-way operation - you will need to re-image your WLAN Pi if there are any issues and you wish to revert)

Aditional python3 modules are required. Complete the following steps:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-smbus
sudo python3 -m pip install pillow

The following steps must also be completed:

    1. Edit the oled-start file : "sudo nano /usr/local/bin/oled-start"

        from:

            #!/bin/sh
            cd /home/wlanpi/NanoHatOLED
            ./NanoHatOLED

        to:

            #!/bin/sh
            cd /usr/local/fpms
            ./NanoHatOLED

    2. Clone the "fpms" repo as wlanpi user:

        cd /usr/local
        sudo git clone https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/fpms.git

    3. Remove the old NanoHatOLED folder:

        cd ~
        sudo rm -rf ./NanoHatOLED
    
    4. Remove the network info cron entry "@reboot /home/wlanpi/NanoHatOLED/BakeBit/Software/Python/scripts/networkinfo/networkinfocron.sh" by editing cron with:

        sudo crontab -e

    5. Sync filesystem:

        sudo sync

    6. Power off/on (not reboot from CLI ) the WLAN Pi
